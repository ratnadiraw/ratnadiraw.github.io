I am a second year Computer Science PhD student in Singapore Management University under <a href='http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/'>Prof. David Lo</a>. Currently, my main research interests are in the topic of software engineering, explainable artificial intelligence, and software debugging. I have published several papers in international conferences and journal in software engineering. I have also collaborated with several researchers and professors during my PhD candidature.
